# Sustainable Free and Open Source Community

Welcome! This is a place dedicated to the discussion, creation, and evolution
of Sustainable Free and Open Source Communities. We are organized around:

 - the development of a set of shared [principles]({{%ref "principles" %}}) that we believe lead to healthy, sustainable open source communities.
 - a set of ready to use [social contracts]({{% ref "social-contracts" %}}) that can be adopted by free and open source software projects that detail the expectations of the community around: leadership, contribution, codes of conduct, and monetary investment.
 - [explanations of various open source business models]({{% ref "business-models" %}}) for those considering starting an open source project.
 - the [SFOSC book]({{% ref "sfosc-book" %}}) that covers the thought process and research that went in to the creation of SFOSC.

Our conception of community is an expansive one – it covers developers, users,
evangelists, venture capitalists – anyone who believes that software is better
when it is built in a community, and that communities are formed because of
a shared understanding between people. We weclome you to read more 
[about SFOSC]({{% ref "about" %}}), or explore one of the sections
highlighted above.

## Join us

We would love to have you help us evolve the principles, write new social contracts, and further explore what it means to create sustainable free and open source communities. There are a couple ways to get started:

  * Send us a [pull request for this website](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc)!
  * Start a conversation by [filing an issue](https://github.com/sfosc/sfosc/issues)

Is itself a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community, using the [Donation Social Contract]({{% ref "social-contracts/donation.md" %}}). The current leader is <a href="mailto:adam@stalecoffee.org">Adam Jacob</a>, but we'll be having our first election soon.
