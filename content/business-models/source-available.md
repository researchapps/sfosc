While copyleft licenses (e.g., [Parity](https://paritylicense.com/), 
[AGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affero_General_Public_License)) were 
originally created to protect intellectual property of a community, they have 
not served well in all cases to protect communities from possibly being taken 
advantage of by a larger corporate entity. For example, a copyleft license may 
allow for use of open source software by a company, and charging for services 
afforded by that software. While industry might give back to the community by 
way of contributions, this is not always the case. In these unfortunate cases, 
the communities get defensive, and the overall dynamic encourages less openness
and sharing because of that. Specifically, we see from this practice:

 1. As a defensive mechanism, software becomes proprietary to protect itself.
 2. New open source licenses are developed as another means of protection.

The second defense mechanism has resulted in discussion about development
of "source available" licenses that dictate terms under which an industry
entity can deploy infrastructure that profits from a piece of software. 
For more background on the development, see 
[this article](https://techcrunch.com/2019/05/30/lack-of-leadership-in-open-source-results-in-source-available-licenses/).

Interestingly, this initiative has resulted directly from a lack of 
initiative on the part of some industry entities to contribute back. It serves
as a powerful example for how soft skills, culture, and supporting a 
software community are essential factors that when neglected, can lead 
to a less open landscape.

### Who uses it?

Currently, the license models are under development and are not in use.

### When should it be used?

The licenses will provide a selection of ways for software communities to 
generally protect themselves from an industry entity that is perceived as a
threat. The licenses will serve to provide limitations on how software is
(or is not) used (e.g., commercially, for software as a service, or other
common patterns of infrastructure deployment).

### What kind of monetization is possible?

In that the licenses can limit use based on company size (employees and/or profits),
use cases (SaaS or non-commercial) the [licenses](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EMbmyG3CNcIL5yJmQOvffo_CZCiwLREZHR3kXvDmPsk/edit#heading=h.qkm1orf63zck) potentially introduce terms that could lead to
a shift in culture - the industry entites that benefit from the software
might take initiative to contribute back to the communities, whether by 
monetary means or open source contributions.

### Does this model help create a Sustainable Free and Open Source Community?

While this model better protects open source communities, it arguably could
lead to some industry entities abandoning specific open source technologies
 and focusing on proprietary software. Only time will tell.
